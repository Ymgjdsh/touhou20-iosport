# Audio runtime recovered as C++

This module implements the actual `SoundInf` object at original VA `0x005ba830`, its effect queue, music command state machine, PCM readers and DirectSound8 backend. The object previously called `ThreadRegistry` is this audio controller. `program_entry::ThreadRegistry` is now a type alias, and `entry_adapter.cpp` defines its one actual global instance.

Production targets `th20_audio_runtime` and `th20_audio_entry_adapter` contain C++ and normal Windows API calls. They do not load, map, launch, patch, or embed instructions from the original executable. The original image is used only by the separate CPU test executable. This module is not a claim that the whole game, every audio failure path or thread timing has been reconstructed identically.

## Evidence and implementation

Evidence is `analysis/ghidra/pseudocode/<VA>.c` and `analysis/binary/disassembly.asm` from the verified original image, SHA-256 `a274b45fe6ec53511718bb328c2ff169a74e67f95d1b0c74d97d348b955a0897`. Assembly was used where Ghidra omitted return values or misidentified types.

Trivial array access and PMR vector allocation/destruction helpers are represented by ordinary typed array/vector operations. Their addresses are not counted as independently validated game behavior.

## Layout and recovered details

`SoundInf` preserves all original offsets through `0x57e8`; a required source-service `Context*` follows this region. Its requests start at `+0x1c`, PMR preload vector at `+0x187c`, metadata pointer at `+0x1890`, 90 effect channels at `+0x1994`, 72 source buffers at `+0x2204`, duplicate counts at `+0x2324`, 32 command records at `+0x2544`, 16 track names at `+0x46c4`, music filename at `+0x56c4` and stream pointer at `+0x57c4`. Music and effect levels are `+0x57dc/+0x57e0`. Compile-time assertions enforce these layouts on x86.

`WaveReader` is `0xa0` bytes. `TrackFormat` is the original packed 52-byte `thbgm.fmt` record. The stream retains original fields through `0xa8`, with its source-owner pointer following them. Its 4-byte packing preserves the original vtable/data layout, including the double fields at `+0x38/+0x40/+0x48/+0x50`.

Preserved observed behavior includes:

- Command slot 31 is a sentinel; additional commands are silently dropped after 31 occupied slots. The preload branch retains the advanced queue pointer after shifting records, matching the original jump.
- Effect-definition records are not sorted by ID. Binding searches the ID, while the request cooldown path indexes the table by ID; this asymmetry is retained.
- Configuration starts at `0x5c4f08`. Audio enable bytes `0x5c4f7d/7e` are configuration `+0x75/+0x76`; signed volume bytes `0x5c4f86/87` are `+0x7e/+0x7f`. Preload is bit 4 of configuration `flags` at `+0x84`.
- The effect volume uses a cubic curve; music volume a quadratic curve; the stored configuration attenuation uses a fourth-power curve. Operation order and truncating SSE conversion are preserved.
- Name lookup prefers the final `/`; only when absent does it use the final `\`. An unknown track returns index 0. This return fallback is present in assembly but omitted by the decompiler.
- The memory reader ignores seek position when reset, applies loop start independently, and `open_memory(...,0)` initializes its fields then returns `E_NOTIMPL`; the original caller ignores that result.
- RIFF traversal advances chunk size plus eight without an odd-byte padding adjustment. A missing resource returns `-1`; failures after resource loading return zero.
- The original starts its window timer with ID 0 and kills ID 1. Original staged shutdown clears a joined thread handle before the later close; that observed field behavior is retained.

## Integration

`audio::bind_game_services()` binds the existing configuration, log, clock and `resources::read` manager to `program_entry::thread_registry`; it does not initialize audio or change startup order. The owner of original loading-thread function `4d8350` should call it before these recovered operations:

```cpp
audio::bind_game_services();
auto& sound = program_entry::thread_registry;
sound.load_formats("../../bgm/thbgm.fmt");
sound.initialize(program_entry::window_state.window, *sound.context);
sound.apply_configuration();
// The loading-thread's original file-existence/preload branch controls whether
// to call start_stream("thbgm.dat") or only store the music filename.
```

The graphics update already calls `audio::update_stream(sound)` in original order `45a1a0 → 45a0c0 → 45a130 → 45a050`. Window shutdown adapters bind `poll_background_jobs`, `stop_audio` and entry dependency `fn_00426170` to actual methods. All locks come from `runtime::shared_locks()`: command/effect processing slot 11, stream refill/seek slot 12, file preload slot 2 and allocation slot 1.

## Build and verification

```powershell
& D:\cmake\bin\cmake.exe -S source_reconstruction/audio_runtime -B source_reconstruction/audio_runtime/build -G 'Visual Studio 16 2019' -A Win32
& D:\cmake\bin\cmake.exe --build source_reconstruction/audio_runtime/build --config Release
& source_reconstruction/audio_runtime/build/Release/th20_audio_cpu_compare.exe '<verified th20.exe path>' source_reconstruction/audio_runtime/cpu_validation.json
& source_reconstruction/audio_runtime/build/Release/th20_audio_backend_smoke.exe source_reconstruction/audio_runtime/build/backend_smoke
```

MSVC uses static CRT, C++20, `/fp:strict` and `/arch:SSE2`. The CPU report binds every production audio source/header, the adapter, and the oracle source to SHA-256 values. The separate backend report is `build/backend_smoke/backend_validation.json`. The backend test uses a hidden owned window and generated silent PCM; it creates all 90 effect buffers, file and memory streams, pauses/resumes/seeks, joins the notification worker, and releases resources without the original executable.

The CPU report covers selected well-defined inputs and controlled host boundaries. Hardware/device-loss timing, arbitrary corrupt metadata, failed/truncated file I/O byte counts, resource exhaustion, and all inter-thread schedules are outside its equivalence claim. Source-side bounds checks reject several original overread/non-progress cases; failed factory cleanup avoids some original leaks. These are explicitly defined error behavior, not evidence of identity to undefined original behavior. The original notification architecture and lock regions are retained; whole-game scheduling and final audible output still require game integration and longer runtime comparison.


## Native iOS port (2026-09-25)

The `TH20_IOS` branch now uses naturally aligned LP64 runtime objects. Original
x86 assertions remain active for x86 builds; corresponding native assertions
verify `SoundInf` (0x5ef0), `EffectChannel` (0x28), `PreloadedTrack` (0x20),
`MusicStream` (0xd8), and `WaveReader` (0xb8). `TrackFormat` remains the original
packed 52-byte resource record. Production audio accesses already used named
members; no original absolute runtime offsets remain in these audio methods.
`MusicStream` keeps 4-byte packing only for the original build.

Native BGM uses `fopen`/`fseeko`/`fread` instead of Windows file handles. The host
must set the game's resource working directory before startup, or provide an
absolute filename. Missing/truncated streams report failure. iOS metadata
validation checks record size, terminating record, PCM format and loop bounds.
Native buffer-lock guards release the backend mixer's lock on failed I/O or
exceptions. The iOS stream factory checks its initial fill result; malformed
music must not silently become an apparently successful stream.

`SoundInf::poll()` consumes `th20_ios_audio_notification_count` only after a
crossed notification block is successfully refilled. iOS does not create the
Windows event, notification thread or timer, and has no Windows thread-teardown
code. Polling remains on the normal game update cadence. The audio backend owns
AVAudioEngine interruption/suspend behavior; game polling must resume alongside
normal updates.

Verification performed:

- All seven production translation units compile with the real Xcode 14 compiler
  for `arm64-apple-ios14.0`; see `build-native-reports/audio-runtime-arm64.json`.
- `native_probe.cpp` exports `th20_ios_audio_runtime_probe(const char*)` for a
  diagnostic app. It must be added explicitly; it has no game main and is not a
  shipping source-manifest entry.
- Actual iOS 16 simulator AVAudioEngine backend: 23 integration checks passed,
  including all 90 effect channels, BGM notification generation/refill,
  file/preloaded streams, pause/resume/seek, missing-file errors, failed-refill
  unlock and ownership cleanup. The saved evidence is
  `build-native-reports/audio-runtime-simulator.log`.

Limitations and remaining work:

- The simulator probe used generated silent PCM. It does not prove original BGM
  fidelity, all-track loop points, long-duration stability, real-device latency,
  interruption recovery, or iOS 14 device compatibility.
- The isolated probe linked the actual six audio core files and native backend,
  with small test-only allocation/log services. Full game service binding still
  requires the game-wide native engine to link and run.
- The host must forward runtime log text to the native session log during play.
  Errors kept only in `runtime::Log` until shutdown are insufficient diagnostics.
- Full archive metadata/resources still need to be played in the completed game.
  New defensive validation can expose previously ignored bad/missing assets;
  those errors must be investigated, not suppressed.
- Original x86 CPU oracle comparisons were not rerun in this iOS phase. iOS-only
  branches intentionally define safer failed-I/O cleanup while the original
  branch and original scalar operation order remain intact.
